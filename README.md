# IPL-Data-Analysis-2007-2017
It is a database analysis of ipl data over first 10 years of ipl using two datasets containing data of each delivery and matches using SQLite and DB Browser to create a database of the data.
I downloaded Datasets from Kaggle [Indian Premier League (Cricket)](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl/data?select=matches.csv)
